## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS utility classes
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a lot of practicing what I already knew (which is always a good experience). But, as always, I did learn something new.

- I got some more practice with `grid`. Compared to `flexbox` I'm not confident with this one. I had some issues with the layout since I completely forgot that `place-items: center;` exists. Got there in the end!

- I also learned how to use the `data-*` attribute to write shorter and cleaner CSS.

### Continued development

I want to become more comfortable with `grid` and the `data-*` attribute.
